I am a Senior JavaScript Programmer, specialized in developing large-scale

TypeSCript, I possess extensive knowledge in React and TypeSCript, enabling me
to develop scalable and efficient web applications.

Within my expertise, I have also specialized in website design, including setup

Furthermore, I have experience in DNS management and domain configuration,
